# Canada Election 2021 Data Analysis
##Introduction
This R script performs an analysis of the Canada Election 2021 data. The data includes variables related to religion, income category, personal finances, education, and gender identity.

## Project Structure
Canada_election_2021_data.RData: The dataset used for analysis.
report-3.R: The R script containing the analysis code.
Required Packages
tidyverse
readxl
dplyr
R.utils
janitor
stargazer
ggplot2
Usage
Load the required packages using library() commands.
Load the dataset using load("path/to/Canada_election_2021_data.RData").
Run the analysis code in report-3.R to perform various statistical analyses and visualizations on the data.

## Analysis Steps
Data Loading and Preparation:

Load the dataset and select relevant variables for analysis.
Remove any missing values from the dataset.
Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate descriptive statistics for variables such as personal finances, education, religion, and gender identity.
Compute standard error and margin of error for key statistics.
Data Visualization:

Generate a bar graph to visualize the distribution of voters based on personal finances.
Contingency Table:

Create a two-way contingency table of gender and education levels.
Convert the table to percentages to analyze the frequency of each combination.
Grouping and T-Tests:

Group education levels into two categories.
Perform t-tests to compare differences in personal finances between the education groups.
Regression Analysis:

Conduct linear regression analysis with personal finances as the dependent variable and education, gender, and religion as independent variables.
Repeat the regression analysis using income category as the dependent variable.
## Results
Descriptive statistics, visualizations, contingency tables, t-test results, and regression analysis outcomes are presented in the script output.
Interpretation and insights from the analysis are provided within the R script.
